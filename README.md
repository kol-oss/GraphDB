## Classes

### Graph

The `Graph` class represents a graph data structure. It provides methods for adding nodes and links, determing keyfield, as well as performing various graph operations.

### Node

The `Node` class represents a node in a graph. It stores information about the node's ID and any additional data associated with it.

### Link

The `Link` class represents a link between two nodes in a graph. It contains information about the target node, and any additional attributes of the link.

## App

### 1-shortest

The `1-shortest` app implements the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. It takes a two nodes as input and returns the distance and shortest path between them.

### 2-select

The `2-select` app provides functionality for searching and selecting data in a graph. It allows users to specify search criteria and retrieve nodes or links that match the criteria.
